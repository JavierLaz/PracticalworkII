        <h1>Machine Learning Roadmap </h1>
        

        <section>
            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>As an aspiring computer engineering student I wanted to know the foundations needed to start a career
                in machine learning. This curiosity pushed me to investigate what resources, skills and knowledge I needed, which together with the fact that 
                Machine learning (ML) has become crucial for deriving insights from complex data and driving innovation 
                across industries,resulted in this summary of objectives. </p>

            <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
            <p>Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn from data and make predictions or 
                decisions without explicit programming. It focuses on developing algorithms that identify patterns, make decisions, and improve over time.
            </p>
            <p>Unlike traditional programming, which uses data and fixed rules to produce answers,
                machine learning uses the seeked results and vasts amount of data to produce rules. These rules
                are then implemented on a model capable of giving the answers based on the input data. 
            </p>
