        <p>A set of tasks assigned by the teacher with the objective of nurturing teamwork and collaboration among 
            classmates. <br>
            The Practical Work I consisted of 3 sections: <ul>
                <li><b>The technical document</b> <br>
                A text document where all the information gathered by the team about the chosen topic 
                was presented in an orderly manner . <br>
            The document had to address the history of the technology, the technologies employed, the advantages and disadvantages
        and finally, an ethical overview of the topic. 
    </li>
            <li><b>The oral presentation:</b> <br>
            An exposition of the topic which aimed to give a clear explanation of the topic and each of 
        it's aspects. The presentation also consisted of specific questions about the topic that allowed 
    the group to show their mastery over the topic. </li>

            <div class="main-title"><h4>2.Development individual work </h4></div>
            <p> The practical work II consists on the development of a website using the 
                practical and theoretical skills learned throughout the term, such as HTML, CSS or Git. 
                It is explained further in <a href="../index.html">here</a>

    <h3>Conclusions</h3>
   </div>
   <p>Fundamentals of computer engineering is a key subject for the proper development of 
    our career because it teaches about almost all the fields of computer engineering, which
    allows the students to think about should they aspire for and have a solid foundation to start 
    developing on their prefered field.
