# PracticalworkII
A repository of a webpage explaining my experience in the double degree of computer science and mathematics in the UFV, with focus on fundamentals of computer engineering and a topic of my choice. 






# Index.html Push

The development of the index page can be explained cronologically and by items: 

## Stages of development:

### Layout: 
    The layout of the webpage was the first development, consisting mainly on sketches of a basic webpage: A header with a navigation bar, main body subdivided in section and footer, implemented in both the css and main file. 

### Classes: 
    The main classes were inspired by the activity iii page and the different ones were brought up depending on the features intended. 

### Items: 
    Once the structure was mainly designed the development focused on putting the content and fixing some incompatibilities and some slight design changes. 



## Files


### CSS file: 
    The creation of the css file was the main task while developing index.html since it is the foundation for the rest of the pages. 
    The css file changes the style of certain tags like nav or header and creates various classes like header-title or main-content. 


### index.html file: 
    The index.html file was created based on the activity iii html file, using the flex display, the containers and the footer structure. 
    While the content was a brief explanation of the project's requirements. 



## Issues 
    Adjusting the different properties of the classes and positions to give a consistent although basic layout. 
    Attempts at implementing certain features too complicated like an email form that would require external code. 

## Solutions
    Most issues were solved by searching examples in pages like w3schools.com and stackoverflow. Although the lack of consistency between sources resulted in a less than ideal framework for scalability and reuse.
